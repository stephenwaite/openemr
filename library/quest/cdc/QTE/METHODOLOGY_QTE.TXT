QTE^18842X^2^Detection of MuSk associated antibodies was performed by
QTE^18842X^3^radioimmunoassay (RIA) using highly purified MuSK
QTE^18842X^4^recombinant antigen(1). The use of purified recombinant
QTE^18842X^5^antigen virtually eliminates non-specific reactivity
QTE^18842X^6^thereby reducing the likelihood of false positive test
QTE^18842X^7^results. Samples are screened at an initial dilution of
QTE^18842X^8^1:10. For samples positive on screen, quantitation of anti-
QTE^18842X^9^MuSK antibody expressed as titer units is calculated from
QTE^18842X^10^comparison of specimen serial dilutions to negative and
QTE^18842X^11^elevated MuSK reference standards.

QTE^90924X^5^associated with NS3 protease inhibitor antiviral therapy and
QTE^90924X^6^the Q80K ploymorphism, which is associated with lower
QTE^90924X^7^efficacy of the NS3 inhibitor simeprevir. Naturally
QTE^90924X^8^occurring protease inhibitor resistant variants may be
QTE^90924X^9^present in a small proportion of treatment-naive HCV-
QTE^90924X^10^infected individuals. In clinical trials, these naturally
QTE^90924X^11^occurring variants did not preclude a sustained virologic
QTE^90924X^12^response in most patients undergoing combination therapy
QTE^90924X^13^that included pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and a
QTE^90924X^14^protease inhibitor. This assay is designed to amplify HCV
QTE^90924X^15^genotype 1a and 1b and is unlikely to successfully amplify
QTE^90924X^16^other HCV genotypes. The limit of detection at which
