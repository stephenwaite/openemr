QTE^103689W^4^during the collection the following steps are recommended.
QTE^103689W^5^Prior to collection, wash the child's hand with soap and
QTE^103689W^6^water, then dry with a clean, low lint towel. Avoid
QTE^103689W^7^recycled paper products and printed towels. Once washed,

QTE^103689W^15^Thoroughly wash the hand/foot with soap and water; dry with
QTE^103689W^16^a clean, low-lint towel. If water is not available,
QTE^103689W^17^cleanse the skin using foaming soaps or alcohol prep pads.
QTE^103689W^18^The finger/heel to be punctured must be free of any
QTE^103689W^19^visible infection or wound(s). Massage the child's
QTE^103689W^20^hand/foot and the lower part of the finger/heel before
QTE^103689W^21^you make your puncture will calm the child and stimulate
QTE^103689W^22^blood flow. Do not squeeze the finger/heel because tissue
QTE^103689W^23^fluid may dilute the specimen.
QTE^103689W^24^Do not allow the cleansed area to touch any articles of
QTE^103689W^25^clothing or non-cleansed skin areas before sample

QTE^14839X^2^(=>18 years old).  If testing pediatric patients
QTE^14839X^3^3-17 years, order K14839- UREA BREATH TEST, PED.

QTE^14839X^5^characteristics for persons under the age of 3 have not

QTE^14839X^7^performed.
QTE^14839X^8^Please note that the specimen is stable for ONLY 7 DAYS.
QTE^14839X^9^2) Verify the patient has been prepared for the test as
QTE^14839X^10^specified in Fasting/Special Diets section.
QTE^14839X^11^3) Open the BreathTek (TM)-UBiT(TM)UBT Collection Kit pouch.
QTE^14839X^12^Remove the cup and the tri-fold wallet. Label each breath
QTE^14839X^13^collection bag to maintain positive patient identification
QTE^14839X^14^using the bar code labels provided. Enter the patient name
QTE^14839X^15^and date in space provided. If collected at a Patient
QTE^14839X^16^Service Center (PSC) also attach our LIS generated bar code
QTE^14839X^17^from the Laboratory computer system.
QTE^14839X^18^Collect the BASELINE breath sample according to the
QTE^14839X^19^following procedure:
QTE^14839X^20^-Remove the blue breath collection bag from the tri-fold
QTE^14839X^21^wallet.
QTE^14839X^22^-Remove the pull-off cap from the mouthpiece of the breath
QTE^14839X^23^collection bag.
QTE^14839X^24^-Instruct the patient to (1) breath normally; (2) take a
QTE^14839X^25^deep breath then pause momentarily; (3) exhale into the
QTE^14839X^26^mouthpiece of the bag causing the bag to inflate. (The
QTE^14839X^27^one-way valve will help prevent escape of CO2).
QTE^14839X^28^-Replace the cap on the mouthpiece of the bag to avoid
QTE^14839X^29^leakage.
QTE^14839X^30^-Label the bag with the time of collection and check the
QTE^14839X^31^box indicating that this is the BASELINE sample.
QTE^14839X^32^4) Prepare the Pranactin(R)-Citric solution no more than
QTE^14839X^33^60 minutes before administering the patient. Urea slowly
QTE^14839X^34^decomposes in water.
QTE^14839X^35^-Remove the Pranactin(R)-Citric pouch from the wallet.
QTE^14839X^36^Tap the upright pouch of Pranactin(R)-Citric to settle the
QTE^14839X^37^contents in the bottom half.
QTE^14839X^38^-with scissors, cut off the top of the pouch and carefully
QTE^14839X^39^tap all of the contents into the plastic cup. Add potable
QTE^14839X^40^water to the fill line indicated on the outside of the
QTE^14839X^41^container by a raised plastic ridge.
QTE^14839X^42^-Replace the lid securely and swirl one to two minutes to
QTE^14839X^43^dissolve the pouch contents. The resulting solution should
QTE^14839X^44^be clear with no particulate matter. If particulate matter
QTE^14839X^45^is present after thorough mixing, the solution should not be
QTE^14839X^46^used.
QTE^14839X^47^5) Instruct the patient to drink all of the solution with
QTE^14839X^48^the straw provided, without stopping. Advise the patient
QTE^14839X^49^NOT to swish the inside of his/her mouth with the solution
QTE^14839X^50^before swallowing.
QTE^14839X^51^6) Set timer for fifteen (15) minutes. The patient should
QTE^14839X^52^sit quietly and should not eat, drink or smoke during the
QTE^14839X^53^fifteen (15)-minute interval.
QTE^14839X^54^7) After 15 minutes have elapsed, remove the pink breath
QTE^14839X^55^collection bag from the tri-fold wallet. Collect the POST-
QTE^14839X^56^DOSE breath sample in the same manner as pre-dose sample
QTE^14839X^57^(section 2 above).
QTE^14839X^58^8) Label the bag with the time of the POST-DOSE sample and
QTE^14839X^59^check the box indicating that this is the POST-DOSE sample.
QTE^14839X^60^9) Store and transport the specimen at 15-30 C (59-86 F)
QTE^14839X^61^until analysis is performed. Higher temperatures may
QTE^14839X^62^increase pressure causing the bag to leak. Keep each pair
QTE^14839X^63^of breath samples together reusing the plastic kit pouch
QTE^14839X^64^provided.
QTE^14839X^65^10) Perform analysis within 7 days of breath sample

QTE^K14839^21^-Remove the blue breath collection bag from the tri-fold
QTE^K14839^22^wallet.
QTE^K14839^23^-Remove the pull-off cap from the mouthpiece of the breath
QTE^K14839^24^collection bag.
QTE^K14839^25^-Instruct the patient to (1) breath normally; (2) take a
QTE^K14839^26^deep breath then pause momentarily; (3) exhale into the
QTE^K14839^27^mouthpiece of the bag causing the bag to inflate. (The
QTE^K14839^28^one-way valve will help prevent escape of CO2).
QTE^K14839^29^-Replace the cap on the mouthpiece of the bag to avoid
QTE^K14839^30^leakage.
QTE^K14839^31^-Label the bag with the time of collection and check the

QTE^K14839^36^-Remove the Pranactin(R)-Citric pouch from the wallet.
QTE^K14839^37^Tap the upright pouch of Pranactin(R)-Citric to settle the
QTE^K14839^38^contents in the bottom half.
QTE^K14839^39^-with scissors, cut off the top of the pouch and carefully

QTE^K14839^43^-Replace the lid securely and swirl one to two minutes to
QTE^K14839^44^dissolve the pouch contents. The resulting solution should
QTE^K14839^45^be clear with no particulate matter. If particulate matter
QTE^K14839^46^is present after thorough mixing, the solution should not be
QTE^K14839^47^used.
QTE^K14839^48^5) Instruct the patient to drink all of the solution with
QTE^K14839^49^the straw provided, without stopping. Advise the patient
QTE^K14839^50^NOT to swish the inside of his/her mouth with the solution
QTE^K14839^51^before swallowing.

QTE^K14839^54^fifteen (15)-minute interval.
QTE^K14839^55^7) After 15 minutes have elapsed, remove the pink breath
QTE^K14839^56^collection bag from the tri-fold wallet. Collect the POST-
QTE^K14839^57^DOSE breath sample in the same manner as pre-dose sample
QTE^K14839^58^(section 2 above).
QTE^K14839^59^8) Label the bag with the time of the POST-DOSE sample and
QTE^K14839^60^check the box indicating that this is the POST-DOSE sample.
QTE^K14839^61^9) Store and transport the specimen at 15-30 C (59-86 F)
QTE^K14839^62^until analysis is performed. Higher temperatures may
QTE^K14839^63^increase pressure causing the bag to leak. Keep each pair

QTE^K91765^8^samples be drawn shortly before courier pick up so they are
QTE^K91765^9^received at the lab within 24 hours. Avoid transport just
QTE^K91765^10^before or during weekends, which can result in preassay
QTE^K91765^11^delay.

QTE^K92677^4^Specimens grossly contaiminated with blood may inhibit the
QTE^K92677^5^PCR and produce false-negative results. The high sensitivity
QTE^K92677^6^of amplification by PCR requires the specimen to be
QTE^K92677^7^processed in an environment in which contamination of the
QTE^K92677^8^specimen by Tropheryma whipplei DNA is not likely.
